# Sports Apparel Match 

This project allows a user to input an image of a sports jersey, hat or shirt and immediately find the product on Amazon. 
It uses Amazon Rekognition to detect text, and Google Cloud Vision to detect logos, color, and categories of the sports
apparel. A search is created using these criteria and the product is retrieved from Amazon. 

A video demo of this project can be found here, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEWbgib38_I.
